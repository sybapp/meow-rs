//! Reusable composable stream-transport layers for meow-rs.
//!
//! Each layer wraps an inner [`Box<dyn Stream>`] and produces a new one.
//! Layers compose by chaining [`Transport::connect`] calls:
//!
//! ```text
//! let tcp:  Box<dyn Stream> = tcp_connect(addr).await?;
//! let s     = tls_layer.connect(tcp).await?;
//! let s     = ws_layer.connect(s).await?;
//! // `s` is handed to the VMess/VLESS protocol codec
//! ```
//!
//! Architecture: [ADR-0001](../../docs/adr/0001-meow-transport-crate.md).
//!
//! # Crate boundary invariants (enforced by CI)
//!
//! * No dependency on any other workspace crate (`meow-common`, `meow-proxy`,
//!   `meow-dns`, `meow-config`). This crate is a protocol-agnostic leaf.
//! * No `anyhow::Error` in any public function signature — only [`TransportError`].
//! * No server-side code (`accept`/`bind`/`listen`/`TcpListener`) in `src/`.
//!   Test helpers in `tests/support/` are whitelisted.
