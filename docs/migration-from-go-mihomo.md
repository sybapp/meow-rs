# Migration guide: Go mihomo → meow-rs

Last updated: 2026-06-19. Tracks the current default app feature set.
Owner: pm. Tracks roadmap item: **M1.H-3**.
Review cadence: updated at each milestone exit.

This document is for operators migrating a working Go mihomo (Clash Meta)
deployment to meow-rs. It covers:

- What config surface is supported, partially supported, or not yet supported.
- Behavioral divergences and what to do about them.
- Migration steps for common subscription types.
- Feature flags equivalent to Go mihomo build tags.

If you are starting fresh (not migrating), read the main README instead.

**Scope note:** This guide describes the default `meow-app` build unless a
feature flag is called out explicitly. Features marked *M2* or later are planned
but not yet shipped.

---

## Quick compatibility check

Run meow-rs with `-t` to validate your config without starting:

```bash
meow -f config.yaml -t
```

Hard errors (Class A divergences) print the upstream field name and the
rejection reason. Warnings (Class B) print once at startup and the config
loads. If `-t` exits 0, the config will load.

## Quick compatibility checklist

Before migrating, scan your config for the following. Items marked ✗ will
cause problems; items marked ~ work with caveats; items marked ✓ work.

## Config surface parity table

### Fields accepted but with changed semantics

These fields parse without error but behave differently from Go mihomo:

| Field | Go mihomo | meow-rs | Class |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `secret` not set | API unprotected | API unprotected (warns at startup) | Same |
| `authentication: ["user:pass"]` | Accepted | Malformed entry (no colon) is hard error | A |
| `authentication: ["user:"]` (empty password) | Accepted silently | Accepted; warn-once | B |
| `skip-auth-prefixes` | Defaults to `[]` | Always includes `127.0.0.1/32` + `::1/128` | A |
| `skip-auth-prefixes` with invalid CIDR | Silently dropped | Hard parse error | A |
| `dns.nameserver: quic://...` | Supported | Hard error with roadmap pointer | A |
| `dns.nameserver: sdns://...` | Warn-drop (silent) | Hard error | A |
| `dns.default-nameserver: tls://...` | Allowed (bootstrap loop risk) | Hard error | A |
| `dns.default-nameserver` absent with encrypted hostname upstream | Fails at first query | Hard error at load | A |
| `nameserver-policy` entry with all URLs stripped | Runtime panic | Hard parse error at load | A |
| `fallback-filter` GeoIP/CIDR gates | Only on primary failure | Also on poisoned responses (non-CN IP, bogon) | A |
| `fallback-filter.geoip: true` with no MMDB | Startup error | Warn-once, gate disabled | B |
| `nameserver-policy` key with `geosite:` prefix | Resolved via geosite DB | Same — resolved via geosite DB (needs geosite DB; warn-skip if absent) | — |
| `nameserver-policy` key with `rule-set:` prefix | Resolved via rule-provider | Same — resolved via rule-provider (domain/classical); `ipcidr` behavior and missing provider are hard errors | — |
| `IN-TYPE` with unknown value (e.g. `IN-TYPE,QUIC`) | Silently no-match | Hard parse error | A |
| `PUT /configs` in-flight connections | Graceful handover | Cold reload, connections dropped + logged | A |
| `PUT /configs` payload with raw YAML (not base64) | Accepted in some versions | 400 with helpful message | B |
| `GET /configs` response includes null Option fields | Full struct with nulls | Only non-null fields returned | B |
| `geodata-mode`, `geodata-loader`, `geoip-matcher` | Valid fields | Ignored with warn-once (M2+) | B |
| `dns.listen` / `external-controller` bind failure at startup | Logs error, daemon keeps running | Hard startup error (process exits non-zero) — no prior listener exists to fall back to (the `dns.listen` half keeps its tolerant keep-old semantics on runtime `PUT /configs` rebind; `external-controller` has no runtime rebind) | A |
| `dns.listen` set while `dns.enable: false` | Silently ignored | Warn-once that no listener is started | B |

### Fields that are silently ignored in Go mihomo but error in meow-rs

Go mihomo ignores many config mistakes without any feedback. meow-rs
follows the policy in [ADR-0002](adr/0002-upstream-divergence-policy.md):
security gaps and typo-likely mistakes become hard errors (Class A).

| Mistake | Go mihomo | meow-rs |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Duplicate listener port | Silently overwrites last | Hard parse error naming both conflicting listeners |
| Duplicate listener name | Silently overwrites last | Hard parse error |
| Unknown listener type (e.g. `type: redir`) | Silently ignored | Hard parse error |
| Shorthand port + `listeners:` entry on same port | Both accepted | Hard parse error (same as duplicate port) |
| `authentication` entry with no `:` | Silently stored with empty password | Hard parse error |
| `authentication` entry with empty username (`:pass`) | Silently accepted | Hard parse error |
| `skip-auth-prefixes` with invalid CIDR | Silently dropped | Hard parse error |
| Malformed IP in `dns.hosts` | Silently skips | Hard parse error |
| `.dat` geosite file in discovery path | Loads (protobuf) | Hard error + conversion hint (`convert-geo`) |
| `sub-rules:` cycle | May panic or loop | Hard parse error |
| `sub-rules:` reference to undefined block | Runtime no-match | Hard parse error |
| `nameserver-policy` entry with zero valid nameservers | Runtime panic at first query | Hard parse error at load |
| `IN-TYPE` with unknown protocol name | Silently no-matches all traffic of that type | Hard parse error |
| Base64 payload with URL-safe alphabet (`-`, `_`) | Accepted in some dashboard versions | 400 with decode-error message |

---

## Protocols

Protocol sections summarize the current default app build unless a feature flag
is called out explicitly.

### Shadowsocks

Fully supported including AEAD-2022 ciphers. The built-in `v2ray-plugin`
and `gost-plugin` WebSocket transports are included, along with
`shadow-tls` (all three protocol versions), `restls` (both
`version-hint` modes; `force-tls12` maps to the `tls12` path), `jls`
(hello-random authentication over a real TLS 1.3 handshake) and
`kcptun` (KCP ARQ with crypt/FEC/snappy over a smux v1 session pool;
UDP relay via UDP-over-TCP). External SIP003 plugin binaries are
supported via `plugin:` on `ss` nodes and `allow-external-plugin` on
providers.

### Trojan

Fully supported. TLS via BoringSSL. WebSocket transport via the
built-in transport layer. gRPC transport is available through the shared
transport layer.

### VLESS

Supported. Plain VLESS uses the UUID auth header and has no body cipher.
Security comes from the outer transport (`tls: true`). XTLS-Vision flow
(`flow: xtls-rprx-vision`) and Reality/uTLS paths are supported in the default
app build.

VLESS post-quantum **Encryption** (`encryption: mlkem768x25519plus…`, Xray's
ML-KEM-768 + X25519 hybrid handshake that 3x-ui now emits) is supported in the
default app build via the `vless-encryption` feature (bundled into `full`, kept
out of `minimal`). All three XOR modes (`native` / `xorpub` / `random`), 1-RTT
and 0-RTT, and multi-key relay chains interoperate with Xray-core / mihomo
servers. On a build without the feature the `encryption:` line is a hard parse
error pointing at the missing feature.

```yaml
proxies:
  - name: vless-example
    type: vless
    server: example.com
    port: 443
    uuid: b831381d-6324-4d53-ad4f-8cda48b30811
    tls: true
    servername: example.com
    skip-cert-verify: false
    flow: ""                    # "" (plain) | xtls-rprx-vision (network: tcp only)
    encryption: ""              # "" / none, or mlkem768x25519plus.native.0rtt.<key>
    network: ws                 # tcp | ws | grpc | h2 | httpupgrade
    ws-opts:
      path: /vless
      headers:
        Host: example.com
    udp: true
```

**Divergences from Go mihomo:**

| Field / behaviour | Go mihomo | meow-rs |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `flow: xtls-rprx-direct` / `xtls-rprx-splice` | Accepted (deprecated upstream) | Hard parse error — use `xtls-rprx-vision` instead. |
| `encryption: mlkem768x25519plus…` (post-quantum Encryption) | Accepted | Supported with the `vless-encryption` feature (in `full`); otherwise a hard parse error naming the feature. |
| `encryption:` any other non-`""`/`"none"` value | Accepted | Hard parse error — VLESS defines no other body cipher. |
| `smux: {enabled: true}` | Multiplexes | Implemented as sing-mux (smux/yamux/h2mux; default h2mux) for sing-box/mihomo servers, plus Xray Mux.Cool (`protocol: muxcool`, VLESS/VMess) for Xray servers. Legacy `mux:` remains accepted. |
| `tls: false` with no outer encryption | Accepted silently | Warn-once at load — traffic is plaintext. |
| `flow: xtls-rprx-vision` over `network: ws`/`grpc`/`h2`/`httpupgrade`/`xhttp` (no `encryption`) | Loads; every dial fails ("failed to use vision") | Hard parse error — Vision needs `network: tcp` with `tls: true` or REALITY. |

**Deferred:** VLESS inbound.

### HTTP CONNECT outbound

Supported. HTTP/1.1 CONNECT tunnel with optional Basic auth and custom headers.
Optional TLS wrapping of the proxy connection.

```yaml
proxies:
  - name: corp-http-proxy
    type: http
    server: proxy.corp.example
    port: 8080
    username: alice             # optional; both username + password or neither
    password: s3cr3t
    tls: false                  # wraps TCP connection to the proxy in TLS
    skip-cert-verify: false     # only used when tls: true
    headers:                    # injected into the CONNECT request only
      X-Forwarded-For: "1.2.3.4"
```

**Divergences from Go mihomo:**

| Behaviour | Go mihomo | meow-rs |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Only `username` set (no `password`) | Undefined | Hard parse error — orphaned credential is almost certainly a typo (ADR-0002 Class A). |
| Proxy auth schemes other than Basic (Digest, NTLM) | Supported | M1 supports Basic only. Unknown auth challenge → `Err(ProxyAuthFailed)`. |
| Proxy returns 407 | `ProxyAuthFailed` | Same, clearly named in logs: "http proxy auth failed". |

### SOCKS5 outbound

Supported. SOCKS5 TCP tunnel (CMD `0x01` CONNECT) with optional username/password
auth. Optional TLS-over-SOCKS5.

```yaml
proxies:
  - name: socks5-node
    type: socks5
    server: 10.0.0.1
    port: 1080
    username: bob               # optional; both username + password or neither
    password: hunter2
    tls: false                  # SOCKS5-over-TLS (uncommon)
    skip-cert-verify: false
    udp: false                  # accepted and ignored in M1; warn-once
```

**Divergences from Go mihomo:**

| Behaviour | Go mihomo | meow-rs |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `udp: true` | UDP ASSOCIATE supported | Accepted; warn-once at parse time. `dial_udp()` returns `UdpNotSupported`. UDP ASSOCIATE deferred to M1.x. |
| Only `username` set (no `password`) | Undefined | Hard parse error (ADR-0002 Class A). |
| Server selects no-auth despite credentials offered | Accepted | Proceeds without sub-negotiation — credentials not sent. This matches upstream behaviour. |

**Domain names preferred over IPs:** if `metadata.host` is set, SOCKS5 sends
an `atyp 0x03` (domain) request. IP-only dial is used only when no hostname is
available. This preserves domain for SNI and logging on the destination server.

### Not supported in the default app build

The following protocols are not available in the default app build. Using them
in `proxies:` will produce a hard parse error unless a feature note says
otherwise:

- **TUIC** — not implemented.
- **WireGuard** — niche; deferred.
- **SSH** — niche; deferred.
- **AnyTLS** — supported. Part of the `full` bundle, so the published release
  binaries carry it; `minimal` builds leave it out (ADR-0007 binary-size caps).

---

## Proxy groups

Duplicate group names — including a group colliding with a `proxies:` entry
or a built-in — are a hard error at load time, same as upstream
(`proxy group %s: the duplicate name`). Duplicate `proxies:` leaf names are
more permissive than upstream: the last declaration wins instead of
erroring. Cyclic group declarations are likewise a hard error matching
upstream's `proxyGroupsDagSort`; meow reports the actual cycle path
(`proxy-group cycle detected: A -> B -> A`) where upstream lists only the
involved names.

### selector, url-test, fallback

Fully supported. `url-test` uses real HTTP GET (not raw TCP).
`select` accepts but ignores `url`/`interval`/`lazy`/`tolerance`/
`expected-status` — warn-once per field; it runs no probe loop (upstream
sweeps static members of every group type since v1.18.4).

### load-balance

Supported in M1.C-1. Two strategies: `round-robin` (default) and
`consistent-hashing` (sticky by destination — mihomo `getKey`: IP-literal
host verbatim, domain reduced to eTLD+1, else `dst_ip`). Periodic
health-check using the same URL-probe mechanism as `url-test`.

```yaml
proxy-groups:
  - name: lb-group
    type: load-balance
    proxies:
      - proxy-a
      - proxy-b
      - proxy-c
    url: https://www.gstatic.com/generate_204
    interval: 300               # health-check sweep, seconds (0 = disabled)
    strategy: round-robin       # round-robin (default) | consistent-hashing
    lazy: false
```

**Divergences from Go mihomo:**

| Behaviour | Go mihomo | meow-rs |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Unknown `strategy` value | Falls back to round-robin silently | Hard parse error — wrong strategy means wrong distribution (ADR-0002 Class A). |
| All proxies dead | Returns a dead proxy slot; dial fails | Returns `NoProxyAvailable` immediately — fast, named failure (Class B). |
| `consistent-hashing` with no alive proxies | Panics (index out of bounds) | Returns `NoProxyAvailable` cleanly (Class A). |
| `consistent-hashing` hash seed | `utils.MapHash` is process-seeded — assignments reshuffle on every restart | Same destination key (`getKey`: IP-literal host → host, domain → eTLD+1, else `dst_ip`) + `jumpHash` over the **full** member list with dead-member retry — but hashed with a fixed FNV-1a-64, so assignments are stable across restarts (Class B, strictly better for stability). |

**Note on "consistent-hashing":** since #621 the key and hash shape match
upstream — destination-keyed `jump_hash` over the full member list, not a
client-IP modulo hash. The remaining difference is the seed: upstream's
`maphash` is seeded per process (assignments are not even reproducible
upstream across restarts); ours is fixed FNV-1a-64. See
`docs/specs/group-load-balance.md` divergence row 4.

### relay

Supported in M1.C-2. Chains ≥2 outbounds in sequence:
`client → proxy[0] → proxy[1] → … → target`.

```yaml
proxy-groups:
  - name: double-hop
    type: relay
    proxies:
      - first-hop    # connects to second-hop's server address
      - second-hop   # connects to the actual target

  - name: triple-hop
    type: relay
    proxies:
      - proxy-a
      - proxy-b
      - proxy-c      # innermost hop connects to the target
```

**Divergences from Go mihomo:**

| Behaviour | Go mihomo | meow-rs |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Single-proxy relay (`proxies` length 1) | Silently acts as passthrough | Hard parse error — likely misconfiguration (ADR-0002 Class A). |
| Empty `proxies` list | Panics | Hard parse error (Class A). |
| UDP through two or more proxy hops (DIRECT hops not counted) | Chains the exit's UDP through the earlier hops | Returns `UdpNotSupported` and the rule is skipped for UDP; chained UDP is a follow-up (Class A). |
| `url:`/`interval:`/`lazy:`/`tolerance:`/`expected-status:` on a relay group | Probes static members (since `90bf158`, v1.18.4) | Warn-once per field; no probe loop runs (Class B). |
| `use:`/`include-all*`/`filter:`/`exclude-*:` on a relay group | Relay accepts provider members | Warn-once per field; relay is static-only (Class B). |

**UDP relay:** UDP always leaves from the chain's exit, never from an
earlier hop. DIRECT hops are dropped first, as upstream does, and the
proxy hops that remain decide:

- none (`[DIRECT, DIRECT]`): UDP goes out directly;
- one (`[DIRECT, ss-b]`): `ss-b` sends the UDP itself, the same exit as
  the chain's TCP. Its own `udp` support decides;
- two or more (`[ss-a, ss-b]`): `dial_udp()` returns `UdpNotSupported`,
  and the group reports no UDP support, so a UDP flow skips the rule that
  targets it. meow cannot yet chain UDP through relay hops.

To get chained UDP today, give the exit node a `dialer-proxy` instead of
a relay group. Shadowsocks and SOCKS5 then open their UDP association
through the front's own UDP relay, and Trojan, VLESS, Snell and mux
sessions carry UDP inside the chained TCP stream (see the `dialer-proxy`
entry under [Known-broken patterns](#known-broken-patterns)).

**Error messages:** intermediate hop failures include the hop index and
the inner error, e.g.: `"relay chain failed at hop 1 (proxy-b → proxy-c): <inner error>"`.

**Group references in relay chains:** listing a Selector or URLTest group
as a relay hop is allowed. The currently-selected proxy in that group is
used at dial time. This matches upstream.

**Non-first hops** run the adapter's full post-connect pipeline — its own
TLS/WS/obfs stack to its own server, then the protocol handshake — over the
preceding hop's stream (mihomo `DialContextWithDialer` semantics).
`direct`, `reject`, `http`, `socks5`, `snell`, `vless`, `vmess`, `trojan`,
`anytls`, and `ss` (built-in obfs/v2ray-plugin/ech-tls-tunnel included) all
terminate a relay chain. Two carve-outs fail loudly instead of silently
misbehaving: `hysteria2` (QUIC/UDP cannot ride a TCP stream — first-hop
only) and `ss` with `gost-plugin`/`shadow-tls`/`restls`/`jls` or an
external SIP003 plugin (the plugin owns its outbound leg — a record-level
transport cannot be replayed over an already-proxied stream). Mux pooling
(`smux`/`yamux`/`h2mux`/`muxcool`) is bypassed on relay hops: a
relay-supplied stream is single-use and cannot be re-dialled.

**No health-check on the relay group itself.** Relay is a fixed chain, not
a pool. For health-aware relay, wrap relay groups inside a Fallback group.

---

## Rules

### Rule types

See quick checklist above for status of each rule type.

### GEOIP

Supported. Uses MaxMind MMDB format (`Country.mmdb`). Discovery chain:

```
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/meow/Country.mmdb
$HOME/.config/meow/Country.mmdb
./meow/Country.mmdb
```

### GEOSITE

Supported (M1.D-2), **mrs format only**. If you have a `.dat` geosite file,
convert it using the MetaCubeX `convert-geo` tool before migrating:

```bash
# Convert geosite.dat → geosite.mrs
metacubex convert-geo geosite.dat -o geosite.mrs
```

Discovery chain: same pattern as GEOIP but for `geosite.mrs`.

Go mihomo supports both `.dat` and `.mrs`. meow-rs supports mrs only
(Class A divergence, ADR-0002).

### rule-providers

mrs and yaml formats both supported (M1.D-5). `inline` type supported.
`interval:` refresh supported for HTTP providers.

**Format auto-detection:** `.mrs` suffix or `Content-Type: application/x-mrs`
→ mrs parser. Anything else → YAML attempt (clear error on binary garbage).

---

## DNS

### Encrypted upstreams (DoH / DoT)

Supported in M1.E-1. URL syntax:

```yaml
nameserver:
  - https://1.1.1.1/dns-query#cloudflare-dns.com    # DoH with SNI
  - tls://8.8.8.8:853#dns.google                    # DoT with SNI
  - udp://223.5.5.5:53                               # Plain UDP (unchanged)
```

**DoQ (`quic://`) is a hard error** with a message pointing at roadmap M1.E-6.
Replace with `tls://` or `https://` equivalents.

**`default-nameserver` required when encrypted upstream uses a hostname** (not
an IP literal). If you specify `https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query` without
`default-nameserver`, config load fails with a clear error. Hard-coded IP
literals (`https://1.1.1.1/dns-query#cloudflare-dns.com`) do not need a
bootstrap server.

### fake-ip mode

Supported. `enhanced-mode: fake-ip` assigns each resolved host a stable
synthetic IP from the configured CIDR. The tunnel rewrites incoming
connections back to the hostname before rule matching, mirroring upstream
`tunnel/tunnel.go::preHandleMetadata`.

```yaml
dns:
  enable: true
  enhanced-mode: fake-ip
  fake-ip-range: "198.18.0.1/16"      # default if omitted
  fake-ip-filter:
    - "+.local"
    - "+.lan"
    - "example.corp"                  # plain entry = suffix match
  fake-ip-filter-mode: blacklist      # default; whitelist also accepted
  store-fake-ip: true                 # optional: persist mappings across restart
```

- **Pool layout.** Network/.1 (gateway)/.2/.3/broadcast are reserved; first
  allocatable is `network + 4`. Effective capacity = `prefix_size − 4`.
  Sequential cursor, wraps on exhaustion and evicts the oldest mapping.
- **Filter.** `BlackList` (default) routes matched hosts through the real
  resolver; `WhiteList` does the opposite. Plain entries are treated as
  suffixes (`example.com` matches `example.com` and any subdomain).
- **AAAA in v4-only configs.** Returns NOERROR-empty so clients fall back
  to IPv4 cleanly. To allocate v6 fake IPs, point `fake-ip-range` at an
  IPv6 prefix (e.g. `fc00::/64`).
- **Persistence.** `store-fake-ip: true` writes `fakeip-v4.json` /
  `fakeip-v6.json` next to the config file (atomic via tmp + rename).
  Differs from upstream's bbolt format — there is no migration path
  between the two on-disk layouts.
- **Flush.** `POST /cache/fakeip/flush` clears every allocation and resets
  cursors. 204 on success.

### hosts and use-system-hosts

Fully supported (M1.E-5). Wildcard entries:

```yaml
hosts:
  "*.corp.internal": "10.0.0.50"     # + Go syntax also accepted (see below)
  "+.corp.internal": "10.0.0.50"     # equivalent; stored identically
```

`*.example.com` is rewritten to `+.example.com` internally at parse time.
Both syntaxes work in config.

## Inbound authentication

```yaml
authentication:
  - alice:hunter2
  - bob:s3cr3t

skip-auth-prefixes:
  - 192.168.0.0/24
```

- Loopback (`127.0.0.1/32`, `::1/128`) is always bypassed regardless of config.
- Entry with no `:` → hard parse error (typo detection).
- SOCKS5: advertises method 0x02 when credentials configured.
- HTTP: returns 407 on CONNECT and forward-proxy requests when auth fails.
- TProxy: auth never applied.

## Removed features

These Go mihomo features are intentionally excluded from meow-rs. Configs
using them will produce a clear error at startup.

| Feature | Reason | Alternative |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| TUIC, WireGuard, SSH protocols | Protocol scope and dependency budget | Revisit in M2+ if users need them |
| TUN inbound | L3-device transparent proxy (issue #326) | `tun:` section with the `listener-tun` Cargo feature |

---

## meow-rs-only features

These exist in meow-rs but have no equivalent in Go mihomo. Dashboard
tools built for Go mihomo will ignore them.

| Feature | Path / Field | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Prometheus metrics | `GET /metrics` | Native scrape endpoint; Go mihomo has no equivalent (M1.H-2) |
| Subscription management API | `GET\|POST /api/subscriptions`, `DELETE /api/subscriptions/{name}`, `POST /api/subscriptions/{name}/refresh` | meow-rs-specific |
| Extended proxy group API | `GET\|POST\|PUT\|DELETE /api/proxy-groups[/:name]` | meow-rs-specific |
| Rule CRUD API | `POST\|PUT\|DELETE /rules[/:index]` | Runtime rule editing |

Keep these under the `/api/` prefix so they do not collide with
Clash-compatible paths.

---

## Feature flags (Cargo features)

meow-rs uses Cargo feature flags where Go mihomo uses build tags:

| Go mihomo build tag / upstream | meow-rs Cargo feature | Default |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|:-------:|
| Encrypted DNS (DoH, DoT) | `meow-dns/encrypted` | on |
| BoringSSL-backed uTLS/ECH paths | `meow-app/boring-tls` | on for `meow-app` |
| Full app bundle | `meow-app/full` | on |
| Minimal app bundle | `meow-app/minimal` | off |
| AnyTLS outbound | `meow-app/anytls` (in `full`, not in `minimal`) | on |

To build without encrypted DNS (smaller binary):

```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features -p meow-dns
```

## Migration steps by subscription type

### Type 1: Standard Clash Meta subscription (SS + VLESS/VMess, rule-set)

Most common format from public providers. Typical issues:

1. **Unsupported proxy types** — TUIC, WireGuard, SSH, ShadowsocksR, and other
   niche upstream protocols still need replacement or removal. AnyTLS works
   out of the box in the release binaries; a `minimal` build needs
   `--features anytls`.
2. **`enhanced-mode: fake-ip`** — supported. Migration from a prior
   meow-rs release that warned-and-fell-back to `normal` is automatic;
   no config change required.
3. **`fake-ip-range` / `fake-ip-filter`** — honoured. Defaults to
   `198.18.0.1/16` when range is omitted; filter defaults to empty
   (`BlackList` mode never skips).
4. **GEOSITE rules with `.dat` files** — convert to mrs format:
   ```bash
   metacubex convert-geo geosite.dat -o geosite.mrs
   ```
5. **`quic://` nameservers** — replace with `tls://` or `https://` equivalents.
   `quic://` is a hard parse error with a message pointing at the roadmap.
6. Run `-t` to validate: `meow -f config.yaml -t`

### Type 2: Enterprise split-tunnel (nameserver-policy, IN-NAME rules)

1. **Named listeners** — `IN-NAME` / `IN-TYPE` rules require the `listeners:`
   array (M1.F-1). Shorthand ports (`mixed-port`, `socks-port`) get auto-names
   (`"mixed"`, `"socks"`) — `IN-NAME,mixed,...` works without changes.
2. **`nameserver-policy` with `geosite:` keys** — entries like
   `"geosite:cn": [...]` work when a geosite `.mrs` database is loaded. If no
   geosite DB is available, those policy entries are skipped with a warn-once.
3. **`authentication:`** — ensure each entry has a colon separating username and
   password. Entries without a colon are a hard parse error.
4. **`skip-auth-prefixes:`** — loopback (`127.0.0.1/32`, `::1/128`) is always
   skipped even if not listed. Invalid CIDRs are a hard parse error.

### Type 3: Transparent proxy (tproxy, Linux)

1. **TUN users** — meow-rs has a `tun:` section (feature `listener-tun`,
   fake-ip-scoped; see `docs/tun.md`), or use `tproxy-port` with nftables
   `TPROXY`/`REDIRECT` rules.
2. **`redir-port`** — not supported. Use `tproxy-port`.
3. **PROCESS-NAME / PROCESS-PATH rules** — platform lookup wired (Linux netlink,
   macOS libproc) via M1.D-1.
4. **Firewall-management polarity is reversed.** In Go mihomo the top-level
   `iptables:` block defaults **off** (the deployer owns redirect rules
   unless they opt in); in meow-rs the equivalent `firewall:` key lives on a
   `listeners:` tproxy entry and defaults **on** (managed nftables/pf table),
   and the `tproxy-port` shorthand is always managed. A config that ran
   externally-managed rules upstream must set `firewall: false` explicitly on
   the listener, or meow will install its own `inet meow_tproxy_<pid>_<seq>` /
   `com.apple/com.meow.tproxy.<pid>.<seq>` pf anchor alongside yours. A stray top-level `firewall:` key warns and is ignored —
   it is not the upstream top-level `iptables:` equivalent; the upstream
   `iptables:` block itself (`enable`/`inbound-interface`/`bypass`/
   `dns-redirect`) is likewise ignored.
5. **UDP TPROXY is opt-in and narrower than upstream.** Upstream's
   `tproxy-port` intercepts TCP **and** UDP; meow-rs's shorthand is TCP-only —
   a migrated deployer steering UDP at it silently blackholes the datagrams
   (they never reach a socket meow owns). To serve UDP, declare a
   `listeners:` tproxy entry with `udp: true`, which requires
   `firewall: false` (the managed firewall only covers host output-chain TCP
   REDIRECT) — upstream's `udp: true` + managed `iptables` combination has no
   direct equivalent. UDP is also IPv4-only (upstream does v6), Linux-only,
   and `prerouting`-scoped; see `docs/tproxy-gateway.md`.

### Type 4: Proxy provider subscription (`proxy-providers:`)

1. **`proxy-providers:`** — supported in M1.H-1 (http + file sources, health-check,
   `include-all` shorthand).
2. **`interval:` refresh** — scheduled for both `http` and `file` proxy
   providers (`http` refetches and rewrites the `path:` cache, `file`
   re-reads). `0`/absent disables the timer; manual
   `PUT /providers/proxies/{name}` always works. One divergence: upstream
   additionally fs-watches `file` providers, so a file edit reloads
   immediately even without `interval` — here an un-`interval`ed file
   provider does not auto-reload.
3. **`use:` in proxy groups** — wired for proxy providers. Provider filters and
   `include-all` shorthands are applied when groups are resolved.

## Known-good patterns

These have been tested against a real subscription and confirmed working:

- Rule-based routing with DOMAIN, DOMAIN-SUFFIX, IP-CIDR, GEOIP rules
- Shadowsocks AEAD proxies with selector group + url-test health check
- Trojan with TLS + WebSocket transport
- VLESS with TLS/WebSocket/gRPC/H2/HTTPUpgrade transports
- VMess AEAD TCP/WebSocket outbound
- Snell v3/v4/v5/v6 outbound with UDP-over-TCP
- Hysteria2 TCP/UDP with Docker integration coverage
- Proxy providers with group `use:`
- Mixed listener on a single port with SOCKS5 + HTTP clients
- TProxy on Linux (nftables mark-based routing)
- DNS with plain UDP nameservers + fallback
- DoH/DoT upstreams, nameserver policy, fallback filter, and fake-IP mode

---

## Known-broken patterns

The following are unsupported or intentionally rejected:

- **`quic://` nameservers** — hard error; replace with `tls://` or `https://`.
- **TUIC / WireGuard / SSH / ShadowsocksR proxies** — hard error; no default-build adapter.
- **AnyTLS proxies in a `minimal` build** — hard error; the `full` bundle and
  the release binaries support them.
- **Snell v1/v2** — hard error; use Snell v3/v4/v5/v6.
- **`vless` with `flow: xtls-rprx-direct`** — hard error; use `xtls-rprx-vision`.
- **External dashboard auto-download** (`external-ui-url`) — not performed.
  `external-ui` / `external-ui-name` *are* supported: point them at a directory
  of static files and it is served at `/ui` in place of the built-in dashboard.
  You must download/extract the dashboard yourself; the zip is not fetched
  automatically (avoids an unzip dependency against the binary-size caps).
- **`dialer-proxy`** — supported for TCP via an injected `TcpDialer`, so the
  outbound's own TLS/Reality/protocol handshake runs on the tunneled stream
  (mihomo's `proxyDialer` model). Chains through any proxy or group and nests,
  with cycle detection. Two carve-outs:
  - *Adapter types that own their transport* — `anytls` and `hysteria2` (QUIC)
    do not dial through the pluggable dialer, and `ss` with an **external**
    SIP003 plugin always reaches that plugin over loopback. These fall back to
    the relay-based wrapper, which works where `connect_over` is implemented
    (all of `direct`, `reject`, `http`, `socks5`, `snell`, `vless`, `vmess`,
    `trojan`, `anytls`, and `ss` — except `ss` with an external SIP003 plugin)
    and otherwise fails loudly at dial time (`hysteria2` stays unsupported:
    QUIC cannot ride a TCP stream). It never degrades to a silent direct dial.
  - *UDP* — datagram associations now follow the chain too (Shadowsocks plain
    relay, SOCKS5 UDP ASSOCIATE): the front proxy opens its own UDP
    association to the inner node's advertised datagram endpoint and the
    protocol framing rides it, failing closed when the front cannot carry
    UDP rather than leaking the real source path. Domain endpoints (a
    domain-named inner server, a wildcard/domain SOCKS5 `BND.ADDR`) are
    handed to the front unresolved so its resolver view decides the
    backend (issue #657); fronts that cannot carry a name refuse
    `NotSupported` and the inner node falls back to a locally-resolved
    literal. UDP carried inside a mux session (`smux`/`yamux`/`h2mux`)
    traverses the chain as before.

  `dialer-proxy` on **provider-sourced nodes** is honoured too (issue #489):
  the name resolves against the live route map at dial time — static proxies
  and groups, but not other provider nodes (they are not registry entries;
  mihomo resolves the same restricted namespace) — and is re-applied on every
  provider refresh. Provider-level `dialer-proxy` and `override.dialer-proxy`
  follow mihomo's unconditional-write precedence — `override` > provider >
  node (`OverrideSchema.Apply` writes last and always wins), and an empty
  `override.dialer-proxy: ""` clears the chain like upstream's
  unconditional write of an empty string. A node whose dialer name never
  resolves keeps loading but fails its dials loudly; a malformed value or
  a self-reference rejects the node instead of silently dialling direct.
  One divergence from upstream: a chain that recurses through dynamic
  provider group membership (invisible to the static cycle check) is
  bounded at 16 hops and fails the dial — Go's growable stacks tolerate
  unbounded recursion where Rust's fixed async frames cannot.
